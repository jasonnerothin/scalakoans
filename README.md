scalakoans
==========

A little repo for my scala koans solutions.

This scala koans project originally started with Dick Wall on bitbucket and then was modified/hosted by SRT solutions courtesy of Dianne Marsh. I just wnated to keep my solutions under version control at github, and didn't want to waste a good private repository credit on it. Plus, someone might find my solutions somewhat useful. Don't know... 

I think that Dick's solutions are up there on bitbucket, and likely to be of a higher quality, but who knows...
